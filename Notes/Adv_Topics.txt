Here, we'll discuss about advance topics in JS

        ------Event Propagation-------
It refers to the process of how events propagate or travel through the DOM (Document Object Model) hierarchy.
In JS, there are 2 phases of event propagation:
1. Capturing Phase, 2. Bubbling Phase.

Eg: here are 3 layers of the box alright

        |____Outer Layer
        |_____Middle Layer
        |_____Inner Layer
    
    So, suppose I am targetting to the inner layer if I click it should display the inner layer,
    When we click to inner layer, the first inner layer will get clicked and then it gets followed by the upper layers as well in a sequence until and unless it reaches to the root element.
    
    That is, the sequence becomes : 
      
        |___Inner Layer
        |___Middle Layer
        |___Outer Layer

    This from bottom to top flow or approach is said to be as: " Bubbling Phase " or "Bottom-Up Approach".

    And if suppose the target phase is again the "Inner Layer", and if first the event starts from root of the DOM and reaches to target element, 
    that is said to be in " Capturing Phase" or "Top-Down Approach".
    
    Then the sequence becomes:

        |___Outer Layer
        |___Middle Layer
        |___Inner Layer

     Also, by default event always travels or works in Bubbling Phase.
