/* What are Timing Based Events?
-> Timing Based Events are those events that occur after a certain time interval or delay.

There are primarily two types of timing based events and they are listed below: 
1. setTimeout() : The setTimeout() is used to execute a function or code block after a specified delay in milliseconds.
2. setInterval() : The setInterval() is used to repeatedly execute a function or code block at a specified interval in milliseconds.


--- NOTE ---
When we just need to call the function without argument, we can simply call the function name 
When we need to call the function with argument, we need to use an anonymous function or fat arrow function to wrap the function call with argument.

1. clearTimeout() : The clearTimeout() method is used to cancel a timeout that was previously established by calling setTimeout().
2. clearInterval() : The clearInterval() method is used to cancel a timed, repeating action which was previously established by a call to setInterval().


Example:
function delayedFunction(){
console.log("Function was delayed by 2000 milliseconds i.e. 2 seconds")
}
const myWork = setTimeout(delayedFunction, 2000); 
clearTimeout(myWork); // This will cancel the above setTimeout() function call.

Do the same for clearInterval().
